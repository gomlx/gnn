# gnn
Graph Neural Network (GNNs) library and tools for GoMLX

> [!Note]
> ğŸš§ EXPERIMENTAL and IN DEVELOPMENT: It's still far from a complete GNN library (like [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/), [TensorFlow GNN](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn) and others. It's being populated with tools the author needs for its projects.
