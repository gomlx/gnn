# gnn
Graph Neural Network (GNNs) library and tools for GoMLX

> [!Note]
> ðŸš§ EXPERIMENTAL and IN DEVELOPMENT: It's no where near from a complete GNN library (like [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/), [TensorFlow GNN](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn) and others. It's being populated and the need arises.

## What is in it?

* `geometry.RadiusEdges`: returns edges between the source and target points that are within a give radius.
  It works for arbitrary dimensions (2D, 3D, etc.).

* `geometry.NearestEdges`: returns the edges between each source point and its closest target point.
  It works for arbitrary dimensions (2D, 3D, etc.).
[//]: # (* `graph.EdgesUnion`: returns the union from a list of edge sets. The edges are sorted in the process.)
